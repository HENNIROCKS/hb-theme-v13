$mapFiles = function (string $subdir, array $exts): array {
    /**
     * Build a map of files from a given subdirectory to their absolute paths.
     *
     * The function scans the directory located at __DIR__ . '/' . $subdir recursively
     * (skipping "." and ".." entries) and returns an associative array where:
     *  - keys are the file paths relative to the provided $subdir, normalized to use
     *    forward slashes and with the matched extension removed, and
     *  - values are the absolute pathnames as returned by SplFileInfo::getPathname().
     *
     * Behavior/details:
     *  - If the computed directory does not exist, an empty array is returned.
     *  - Only regular files are included; directories and non-file entries are ignored.
     *  - Files are included only if their extension (the substring after the final '.')
     *    matches one of the entries in $exts.
     *  - The extension check used to decide inclusion is strict (in_array with strict
     *    comparison) against the lowercase extension derived from the file. To avoid
     *    surprises, provide $exts in lowercase (e.g. ['php', 'html']).
     *  - The key-generation step removes the file extension using a case-insensitive
     *    regex built from $exts (so "File.PHP" will have its extension stripped even if
     *    $exts contains 'php').
     *  - If multiple files produce the same key (e.g. foo/index.php and foo/index.html
     *    when both extensions are allowed), later entries in the iteration overwrite
     *    earlier ones.
     *
     * Parameters:
     *  @param string   $subdir Relative subdirectory path (relative to this file's __DIR__).
     *  @param string[] $exts   List of allowed file extensions (without the leading dot).
     *
     * Return:
     *  @return array<string,string> Map of "relative/path/without/extension" => "absolute/path/to/file"
     *
     * Example:
     *  Given directory structure:
     *    site/plugins/my-plugin/snippets/header.php
     *    site/plugins/my-plugin/snippets/partials/nav.html
     *
     *  Calling:
     *    $mapFiles('snippets', ['php', 'html']);
     *
     *  Might return:
     *    [
     *      'header' => '/full/path/to/site/plugins/my-plugin/snippets/header.php',
     *      'partials/nav' => '/full/path/to/site/plugins/my-plugin/snippets/partials/nav.html',
     *    ]
     *
     * Performance:
     *  - The function walks the directory tree once; runtime is proportional to the
     *    number of files and directories under $subdir.
