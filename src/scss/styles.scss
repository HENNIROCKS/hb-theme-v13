/**
 * TODO:
 * - Update the handling of stylesheets so that only one style.css and several individual template.css are generated and put into assets
 *   - Goal is using <?php echo css(['assets/css/styles.css', '@auto']) ?>
 *   - Consider favorising Vite over Gulp for this
 *   - Consider scrapping SCSS in favor of native CSS with help of PostCSS
